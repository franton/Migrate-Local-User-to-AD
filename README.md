# Migrate-Local-User-to-AD

This script is to help migrate local user accounts to Active Directory accounts. It assumes that the proper AD accounts have already been created and the computer is bound properly.

Script is meant to be run as root via a Casper Policy. It also requires CocoaDialog for all the user interaction.

Consider this to be highly unstable and a work in progress!
